=========

This project was written as an accessibility aid while playing [The Witness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witness_(2016_video_game)).
The idea is to convert video of an object in 3D space into a static image.

For example, imagine recording video while walking around a column which is wrapped in a poster.
The goal of this project is to reconstruct an image of the poster from the video.
